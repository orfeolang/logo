# Orfeo's Logo

Orfeo's logo is made up of the `ORFEO` text with the first `O` being
drawn as a lyre, Orpheus' musical instrument in Greek Mythology.

The letters `RFE` are based on the `Akzidenz-Grotesk` font sometimes
called `Standard` or `Basic Commercial`. The `R` is unchanged, but both
the `F` and `E` have been simplified to be more symmetrical. Both `O`s
are fully custom made.

The lyre's four strings are drawn as uniquely sized bars that represent
four different notes or pieces of data.

The text is in a red-wine color, while the bars are in a
green-grape tint.
